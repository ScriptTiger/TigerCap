# TigerCap
TigerCap is an ffmpeg script to capture audio from an audio device and encode it to a WAV file. Also included is a compression script to compress WAV files to FLAC files. The purpose of TigerCap is to facilitate audio recording with as minimal a footprint as possible to produce the best possible encoding of the audio with minimal artifacts.
